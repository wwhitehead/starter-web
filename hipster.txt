Sure, let the little fruit do it. HUZZAH! That's the first time we were in the shower since our honeymoon. And this time, no tears.

Touché, Pandora. I run a pretty tight ship around here. With a pool table. It's a gaming ship. I'm tired of trying to find happiness through lies and self-medicating. If you need me, I'll be at the bar. Do the right thing here. String this blind girl along so that dad doesn't have to pay his debt to society.

You might wanna lean away from that fire since you're soaked in alcohol. I thought the two of us could talk man-on-man. Steve Holt? The moron jock? I've got a nice hard cot with his name on it.

In the dark, it all looks the same. Michael, look, this has got to stop. I mean, flattered? Yes. Interested? Not tonight. Shémale. Buster, what are you doing with mother's rape-horn?
